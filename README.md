Overview
This repository provides an implementation of clustering the Iris dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is used for dimensionality reduction to visualize and cluster the dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers.

Features
Dimensionality Reduction: Utilizes PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
Clustering: Implements clustering algorithms to group similar iris samples based on reduced dimensions.
Visualization: Includes plots for visualizing the clusters in 2D space.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
